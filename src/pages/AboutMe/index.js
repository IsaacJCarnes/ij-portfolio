        Hi I'm Isaac Joshua, a full stack developer from Pittsburgh,
        Pennsylvania. My interests include but are not limited to, 3D modeling,
        sound design and coding as it relates to art. My interest in technology
        started at a young age. I spent several summers in elementary school in
        robotics camps, and in middle school I joined my school's Lego
        robotics team. Although originally I had planned to become a robotic
        engineer, in 10th grade I started to learn and experiment with coding
        and quickly realized that was my true passion in life.
