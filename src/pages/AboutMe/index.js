        Hi, I'm Isaac Carnes. I'm a software engineer from Pittsburgh,
        Pennsylvania. My interests include but are not limited to, 3D modeling,
        sound design and coding as it relates to art. My interest in technology
        started at a young age. I spent several summers in elementary school in
        robotics camps, and in middle school I joined my school's Lego
        robotics team. Although originally I had planned to become a robotic
        engineer, in 10th grade I started to learn and experiment with coding
        and quickly realized that was my true passion in life.
